						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="./Shahidul Haque Afgani Portfolio_files/IMG_0284.JPG" alt=""></span>
								
								<p> <class="justify">
									Passionate about the field of mechanical engineering. With a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Mechanical Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, I've embarked on a journey driven by my unwavering enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving.
				                    My educational background has instilled in me a strong foundation in mechanical engineering, and it has ignited a curiosity that propels me forward. The knowledge and skills I've acquired during my academic journey have not only provided me with a comprehensive understanding of mechanical systems but have also fueled my desire to explore the limitless possibilities within this dynamic field. <br> 
									My higher educational endeavors began at Notre Dame College, where I completed my Higher Secondary School Certificate, focusing on the Science stream. This phase of my academic life taught me the importance of discipline and a holistic educational background. 
									Before these significant educational milestones, my journey commenced at Titas Gas Adarsha High School, introducing me to the world of learning and sparking my initial interest in the wonders of knowledge. <br>
									Beyond my academic pursuits, I am not just an ardent mechanical engineer but also a dedicated sportsperson. My two great passions are cricket and football. Cricket, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, and it's my most favorite sport. I am proud to have achieved the title of "Intra-School Cricket Champion" and "Intra-Department Cricket Champion," showcasing my dedication to the sport. Additionally, my passion for football led my team to secure the title of "Intra-School Football Runners-up," a testament to our teamwork and dedication on the field. <br>
									I firmly believe in the importance of a well-rounded life, and these sporting interests keep me physically active, foster teamwork, and provide a refreshing balance to my daily routines.
								    Guided by values of integrity, determination, and empathy, I am dedicated to lifelong learning, self-improvement, and making a positive impact in the world. <br>
									
									My journey is an ever-evolving story, and I eagerly look forward to the opportunities, challenges, and experiences that lie ahead. I am excited to continue my personal and professional growth, connect with fellow enthusiasts, and contribute to the ever-advancing world of mechanical engineering while pursuing my passion as a sportsperson, with a special love for cricket. </class="justify"></p>

					<p>
						Leadership experience is a transformative journey that molds character and forges vision. It's not merely about titles and positions,but rather about the profound impact one life can have on another.
                        This journey has played a pivotal role in shaping who I am today. It's taught me the power of influence, empathy, and unwavering determination. As I've navigated the path of leadership, I've not only become a better leader but also a mentor, guiding others to reach their potential. <br>
                        In this evolution, I've learned to translate vision into reality and have been inspired by John Quincy Adams' words: "If your actions inspire others, you are a leader." Leadership experience has been instrumental in my personal growth, resilience, and unwavering commitment to making a meaningful impact.
